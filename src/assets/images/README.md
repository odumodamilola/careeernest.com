# Image Assets Directory

This directory contains all the image assets used in the Career Nest application.

Currently, the application is using external image URLs. To improve performance and reliability, we should:

1. Download and store images locally in this directory
2. Use appropriate image formats (SVG for icons, WebP for photos)
3. Implement proper image optimization
4. Update image imports in components to use local assets

When adding images:
- Use descriptive filenames
- Organize by feature/component if needed
- Include image optimization in build process
